# ChatBot
This Python chatbot runs in a loop, responding to user input with preset replies. It greets, shares its name, reacts to questions like "how are you" or "weather", and exits when the user types "bye". If input isn't recognized, it asks for clarification. It uses simple `if-elif` logic and modifies behavior based on keywords.
